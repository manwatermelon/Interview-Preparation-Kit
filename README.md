# Interview-Preparation-Kit
Software engineering interview preparation useful info

## Youtube resources

### Gaurav Sen
A lot of videos; problems, algo, structures and system design. Sometimes hard to watch cause of camera autozoom. Still worth a try.

### CS Dojo
Compact videos on algo, structures, problems.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A

### GeeksForGeeks
A lot of resources on problems, contains code solutions.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0RhatS1pyxInC00YKjjBqQ

### Irfan Baqui 
Whiteboard Thursday good series on how to approach coding questions. Best video resource on interview emulation.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYvQTh9aUgPZmVH0wNHFa1A

### Success In Tech – good design question breakdown, easy to understand. Good videos on concepts.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-vYrOAmtrx9sBzJAf3x_xw

### Hackerrank 
Two playlists by Gayle Laakmann McDowell on structures and solving interview questions + algo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhJGJG-9Dx8&list=PLI1t_8YX-Apv-UiRlnZwqqrRT8D1RhriX - data structures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEEKn7Me-ms&list=PLI1t_8YX-ApvMthLj56t1Rf-Buio5Y8KL - algo

## Coding websites

### Hackerrank 
One of the best resources to solve problems, learn new things and get the grasp on how web coding editors work (surprise, you should not expect much from them).
https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit best compiled problem kit.
https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures - training set + starting point

### LeetCode
Basically the same as hackerrank, compares your results to other submissions.
https://leetcode.com/ 

### GeeksForGeeks 
Contains good amount of interview questions, even by employer. Amazing resource.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/

### Pramp
https://www.pramp.com/ - the best so far resource to train remote (phone like) coding interview to get over interview anxiety. Also has behavioral, system design, Frontend and Applied Data Science (general) sections. Strongly recommend to get practice via Pramp. The session is splitted in two parts, in one of them you are interviewer and your partner is interviewee, then you switch sides.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe4-BhJ5DYy3TY3_ctZMdRg - examples

### Interviewing.io 
Right now is in private beta. Basically should be the same as Pramp, but as I've understood with real engineers volunteering to practice interviews.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNc-Wa_ZNBAGzFkYbAHw9eg - example


## System Design

Perfect resource on system design

## Books:

### Cracking the coding interview - Gayle Laakmann McDowell
De-facto standard. Must read before any engineering interview. Contains many problems with solutions.
http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/

### Elements of Programming Interviews - Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash, and Tsung-Hsien Lee
A bit advanced and different approach compared to Ctci. 
https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/
https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge

### Introduction to Algorithms - Charles E. Leiserson, Clifford Stein, Ronald Rivest, and Thomas H. Cormen
Old but gold.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms


## Interview Process

### Dan Croitor
Good videos on overall interviewing process. Focused more on Amazon and behavioral principles, still can be applied to general engineering positions.
